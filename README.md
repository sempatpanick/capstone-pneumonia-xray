# Pneumonia Detection from XRay Images
In this day and age, we all know that a deadly virus called Covid-19 is circulating. This has become a global problem for the last 2 years which is quite serious. Considering that currently there is no drug that can effectively cure people exposed to the Covid-19 virus. Based on alodokter.com, the characteristics of people exposed to the Covid-19 virus are fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. As for the characteristics of people affected by pneumonia are shortness of breath, pain in the chest, and fever. Can be seen based on the characteristics or symptoms, these two diseases can be said to have almost the same characteristics.
Because of this, our Alvex team took the initiative to create a pneumonia detection application to help doctors/experts take appropriate and rapid treatment measures to detect whether a patient has pneumonia or not. If the results of our application state that you have Pneumonia, hopefully the doctor/expert can provide the right treatment. Vice versa.
